# Threat/Adversary Models

## Passive Attacks
Passive attacks involve monitoring or eavesdropping on communications without altering the data. Denial in passive attacks would occur if an attacker interferes with the monitoring process, preventing legitimate parties from gaining access to necessary information. Communication is not hindered by these attacks.

## Active Attacks
Active attacks involve tampering with data or disrupting systems. Denial in active attacks might involve preventing users from accessing services or data, or altering communications to deceive or disrupt. This actively hinder communications

## Security Attacks and Violations of Security Services
Security attacks violate the principles of security services like confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation, and availability. Denial of these services can occur through actions such as:
- **Confidentiality violation**: Unauthorized exposure of sensitive data.
- **Integrity violation**: Deliberate alteration or corruption of data.
- **Authentication violation**: Unauthorized access or denial of legitimate access.
- **Non-repudiation violation**: Disputing responsibility for actions taken.
- **Availability violation**: Denying access to services or data.
