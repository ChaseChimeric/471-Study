## Notions of Symmetric Key Cryptography and Computational Security
- **Symmetric Key Cryptography**: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
- **Computational Security**: A cipher is considered secure if breaking it requires impractical computational effort (e.g., brute force attack requires centuries of computing time).
