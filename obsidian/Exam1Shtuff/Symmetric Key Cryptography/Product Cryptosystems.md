## Product Cryptosystems
- **What is an idempotent cryptosystem?**  
  - A cryptosystem is **idempotent** if encrypting a plaintext more than once does not change the ciphertext beyond the first encryption.
  - **Impact on security**: If a system is idempotent, applying encryption multiple times does not strengthen security. Attackers could exploit this property to break the cipher more easily.
