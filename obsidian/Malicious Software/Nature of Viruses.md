# The Nature of Viruses

## Definition
A **computer virus** is a type of malicious software that attaches itself to legitimate programs or files and spreads to other programs/computers when executed.

## Characteristics
- Requires host program to propagate.
- Often spread via infected files, emails, or removable media.
- May damage data, degrade performance, or facilitate further attacks.

## Virus Life Cycle
1. **Dormant Phase:** Virus is idle and not yet active.
2. **Propagation Phase:** Virus replicates by infecting other files/programs.
3. **Triggering Phase:** Virus is activated by a specific event or condition.
4. **Execution Phase:** Malicious payload is unleashed (e.g., delete files, corrupt data).

## Types of Viruses
- **File Infector:** Infects executable programs.
- **Boot Sector Virus:** Infects system boot sector.
- **Macro Virus:** Infects documents with macros (e.g., Word/Excel).
- **Polymorphic/Metamorphic Virus:** Modifies its code to avoid detection.
