# Worms

## Definition
A **worm** is a standalone, self-replicating program that spreads rapidly across computers and networks, exploiting vulnerabilities without needing to attach to a host file.

## Characteristics
- Does not require user intervention to propagate.
- Can spread via networks, email, or infected websites.
- May consume network bandwidth and degrade system performance.

## Notable Worms
- **Morris Worm (1988):** One of the first Internet worms.
- **ILOVEYOU, Nimda, Code Red:** Infamous examples with global impact.

## Payload
Some worms simply propagate, but others deliver a malicious payload, such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or launching denial-of-service attacks.

## Prevention
- Regular software updates/patches.
- Firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
- Cautious behavior regarding email attachments and downloads.
