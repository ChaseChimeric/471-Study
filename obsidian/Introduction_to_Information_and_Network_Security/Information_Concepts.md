# Information Concepts

## Confidentiality
Confidentiality ensures that information is only accessible to authorized individuals. Denial of confidentiality occurs when unauthorized individuals can access sensitive data, compromising privacy and security.

## Integrity
Integrity ensures that data remains accurate and unaltered. Denial of integrity happens when data is modified, deleted, or corrupted, either intentionally or accidentally, leading to false or unreliable information.

## Authentication
Authentication verifies the identity of users or systems. Denial of authentication occurs when an unauthorized user gains access to a system or a legitimate user is falsely denied access, undermining the trust in the identity verification process.

## Non-repudiation
Non-repudiation ensures that actions or transactions cannot be denied. Denial of non-repudiation happens when an entity can deny performing an action, making it impossible to prove that they took part in the transaction or action.

## Availability
Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed. Denial of availability happens during denial of service (DoS) attacks, where a system or network is deliberately made unavailable or inaccessible to legitimate users.
