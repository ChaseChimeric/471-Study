To start, the DAA (Data Authentication Algorithm) is defined to use CBC mode of DES with an IV of 0,
$$C_i = E_K(C_{i-1}\oplus M_i)$$
where $C_i$ is the ith cipher block, $E_K$ the encryption key, and $M_i$ is the ith block. 
Here the final ciphertext block $C_n$ is used as the authentication code.

now to show how Cipher feedback is similar in effect
the encryption process in this case is as follows,
$$C_i=M_{i}\oplus E_K(C_{i-1})$$
and we can adjust the behavior of CFB to actually emulate CBC by making $M_i$ be $C_{i-1}$. this makes the final encryption results the same, and we only care about the last block for authentication.

We know that the first block,
$$C_1=E_K(X)=T$$
To calculate the second block,
$$C_2=E_K((X\oplus T) \oplus C_1)$$
and since $C_1 = T$
$$C_2=E_K((X\oplus T) \oplus T)$$
using the identity $A\oplus B \oplus B = A$
$$C_2=E_K(X)$$
and we know that is just equal to $C_1$, which is still just equal to $T$

#### a)
We are assuming that the sender transmits the message $M$, along with the keys $k_i$ and $K_i$. The receiver will then check which bit corresponds to which key. After that the receiver will encrypt the encrypted message bits $u_i$ and $U_i$ to get the corresponding values for $v_i$ and $V_i$. The receiver then checks if the newly generated bits match the shared bits.

#### b)
There are some issues, one of which being lack of security if the keys are used multiple times. for example,
for simplicity we make the block size 4 bits, if we sign the message $M_1$=0'b0101 and $M_2$=0'b1010 with the same keys then the following key scheme is used. $k_1$ $K_2$ $k_3$ $K_4$ for $M_1$, and $K_1$ $k_2$ $K_3$ $k_4$ for $M_2$. This means that the key bits for each pair $(k_i,K_i)$ have been exposed and can be recreated using the bits that are attached.

#### c)
- The secret keys must only be used once per key pair.
- If the same set of secret keys is used for multiple messages, an attacker will eventually learn all key pairs and can forge signatures.

Thus, each key set should be used for exactly one message and then discarded.

#### d)
- Large Key Storage Requirements
	- For an n-bit message, the signer needs $2n$ secret keys and the receiver needs to store all $2n$ public verification values
- One-Time Use Limitation
	- As mentioned, the keys can only be used once per message, requiring a fresh set of keys for every new signature.
	- This is impractical for real-world digital signatures where users need to sign multiple messages over time.

#### a)
were given the modular expression $3^{201}mod11$, to start
we can separate $3^{201}$ to $(3^{10})^{20} * 3$
Fermat's theorem states that $a^{(p-1)} mod p = 1 mod p$
$a = 3$
$p = 11$
so $(3^{10})^{20} * 3=(1)^{20}*3=3mod11$
#### b)
Because the modulo is a prime number, we can setup fermats theorem to use in a similar way to part (a). 
we have $$x^{85}\equiv6mod29$$
$$(x^{28})^{3}*x\equiv6mod29$$
we can then assume that $x^{28} = a^{(p-1)}$
$$(1^{28})^{56}*x\equiv 1*x \equiv 6mod29$$
this means that x = 6

#### a)
$$a^{\phi (10)}mod10=7^{1000}mod10$$
Here we can find that $\phi (10)=4$, so we can make the right side $(7^4)^{250}$ and use Eulers theorem
$$(7^4)^{250}mod10 = (1)^{250}mod10 = 1$$
so a = 1

#### b)
lets start by asserting that $x$ is coprime to 35 and since we are given 6mod35, lets try that first.
the totient function of 35 is 24 which makes the equation
$$(x^{24})^{3}*x = 6mod 35$$
We factor out one x to make the next step of finding the int x. 
$x^{24}$ is congruent to 1 in mod 35 if coprime, so this becomes
$$(1)^{60}*x=6mod35$$
where we find our initial assumption is correct and x=6

1. Sign the Message (Authentication & Integrity):  
    Alice can generate a hash of the message and encrypt this hash with her private key to create a digital signature. She can then append this signature to the original message.
2. Encrypt the Signed Message (Confidentiality):  
    Alice can then encrypt the combined message and signature using Bob’s public key. This ensures only Bob can decrypt it with his private key.
3. Verification
    - Bob decrypts the message with his private key.
    - He would then re-compute the hash of the message and decrypt the signature using Alice’s public key.
    - If the decrypted hash matches the computed hash, the message is authentic, unaltered, and from Alice.
## 8
The plaintext MM is found by decrypting the ciphertext C=10 using the private key d derived from the public key e=5 and n=35.

1. find the totient function of 35, previously found to be 24
2. now we can find the private key $d$ by $$5d\equiv1mod24$$ d=5
3. now $M\equiv C^5mod35\equiv 10^5mod35$ which equals 5mod35.
## 9
The method is not secure. There is a vulnerability because each alphabetic character is encrypted separately using RSA, despite the small message space of 26.  
An attacker can exploit this by:  
1. Precomputing all 26 possible ciphertexts using the public key (e, n):  
   $c_i = i^e \mod n \quad \text{for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, 25$.
2. Comparing the intercepted ciphertext blocks to this precomputed ones.

#### a)
Yes, the checksum will detect all errors caused by an odd number of error bits. The XOR acts as a parity check, an odd number of bit flips will alter the XOR result. Since RXOR also processes the same bits, the combined checksum ensures detection of all odd bit errors.
#### b)
No, this checksum will not detect all errors with an even number of error bits. Errors go undetected if the flipped bits form pairs that cancel out both XOR and RXOR.
#### c)
Ineffective for authentication. The XOR and RXOR functions lack collision resistance. Attackers can easily engineer collisions by strategically flipping bits to preserve the checksum
