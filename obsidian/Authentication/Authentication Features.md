# Authentication Factors

Authentication verifies a user's identity to a system. There are generally four categories of information used in authentication:

1. **What you know:**  
    - E.g., Passwords, PINs, secret questions
2. **What you have:**  
    - E.g., Security tokens, smart cards, one-time password (OTP) devices, mobile phones
3. **What you are:**  
    - E.g., Biometrics (fingerprints, retina scans, voice recognition)
4. **Where you are:**  
    - E.g., Geolocation, IP address, network origin

Strong authentication often combines multiple factors (multi-factor authentication), increasing security by requiring different types of information.
