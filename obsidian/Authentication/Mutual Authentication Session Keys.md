# Mutual Authentication, Session Keys, and Forward Secrecy

## Mutual Authentication
- Both client and server authenticate to each other.
- Prevents impersonation attacks (e.g., man-in-the-middle).
- E.g., Both sides prove knowledge of a shared secret or present valid certificates.

## Session Key Establishment
- Temporary keys generated for each session (e.g., via Diffie-Hellman key exchange).
- Limits the impact of key compromise to a single session.
- Ensures confidentiality and integrity of session data.

## Forward Secrecy
- If session keys are compromised, other sessions remain secure.
- Achieved by using ephemeral keys for each session.
- Prevents attackers who obtain long-term secrets from decrypting past session traffic.

**Overall**, mutual authentication, secure session key establishment, and forward secrecy are critical for robust authentication and secure communications.
