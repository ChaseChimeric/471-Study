# Unique Security Threats of Wireless Networks and Mobile Devices

Wireless networks, especially within enterprises, present unique security challenges:

- **Accidental/Malicious Association:** Devices may unintentionally connect to unauthorized or malicious access points, potentially exposing sensitive data.
- **Eavesdropping:** Wireless signals can be intercepted by attackers outside physical premises, increasing the risk of data interception and identity theft (MAC spoofing).
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Attackers can impersonate legitimate access points to intercept and manipulate communications.
- **Ad hoc and Nontraditional Networks:** Peer-to-peer and personal network devices (e.g., Bluetooth, barcode scanners) pose risks due to lack of central point of control.
- **Lack of Perimeter:** Mobile devices regularly move in and out of the enterprise boundary, weakening traditional “trusted internal/external” network separation.
- **Device Vulnerabilities:** Mobile devices may be lost, stolen, or left unattended, increasing exposure to physical and malware threats.
- **External Business Requirements & De-perimeterization:** Increased use of cloud services and BYOD policies further blur control boundaries, demanding stronger security practices.

These factors mean that wireless and mobile security must address not just technical vulnerabilities but also physical and organizational risks.
