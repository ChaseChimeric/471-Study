# Principal Elements in a Mobile Device Security Strategy

An effective mobile device security strategy within an enterprise should include:

- **Assume Devices May Be Lost/Stolen:** Enforce that sensitive data is not stored or is always encrypted.
- **Strong Authentication and Access Control:** Require the use of passwords, biometric login, and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- **Device Management:** Use Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions to enforce security policies, remotely wipe lost devices, and control application installation.
- **Network Controls:** Restrict which devices can connect to wireless networks (e.g., approved MAC addresses).
- **Encryption:** Ensure encryption is used for both stored data and wireless communications (e.g., WPA2/WPA3).
- **Software and Firmware Updates:** Keep OS and apps patched to reduce vulnerabilities.
- **Monitoring and Response:** Track device activity and be prepared to respond to breaches or suspicious behavior.
- **User Training:** Educate employees about threats such as phishing, social engineering, and secure wireless use.

Security policy must acknowledge that not all devices are trustworthy and that attackers may gain physical access to mobile hardware.
