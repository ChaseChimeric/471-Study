# Comparison of Kerberos, IPSec, and SSL: Scope and TCP/IP Stack Placement

This section compares Kerberos, IPSec, and SSL/TLS security technologies, highlighting their purposes, scopes of applicability, and where they operate within the TCP/IP protocol stack.

---

## 1. **Kerberos**

### **Scope of Applicability**
- Designed for **authentication** in distributed client-server environments.
- Commonly used in enterprise networks for secure network logins and access to services.
- Focuses on authenticating users and services, not on encrypting all data transmissions.

### **Implementation Location**
- **Application Layer** (Layer 7), with some operations at the Session Layer (Layer 5).
- Integrated into authentication protocols and systems (login, network services using Kerberos tickets).

### **Key Features**
- Uses secret-key cryptography (symmetric keys).
- Employs a trusted third party (Key Distribution Center, KDC).
- Provides mutual authentication between clients and servers.
- Does **not** encrypt all user/application data, only authentication exchanges.

## 2. **IPSec**

### **Scope of Applicability**
- Provides **security at the IP (network) layer** for all IP traffic.
- Can protect any protocol that runs over IP, including TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
- Used for Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), securing site-to-site or remote communications.

### **Implementation Location**
- **Network Layer** (Layer 3).
- Integrated into the IP stack, transparent to applications and upper layers.

### **Key Features**
- Offers encryption, integrity, and authentication of IP packets.
- Uses protocols such as AH (Authentication Header) and ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload).
- Provides protection for all or selected IP traffic, independent of application.

## 3. **SSL/TLS**

### **Scope of Applicability**
- Provides **secure communication between applications** (e.g., web browsers and servers).
- Commonly used to secure HTTP (HTTPS), email (SMTPS/IMAPS), and other application protocols.
- Focuses on establishing encrypted, authenticated sessions for application data.

### **Implementation Location**
- **Transport Layer** (Layer 4, between Application and Transport in practice).
- Runs above TCP and below application protocols.

### **Key Features**
- Negotiates encryption and authentication parameters during handshake.
- Provides confidentiality, integrity, and optional client/server authentication.
- Application-aware (application must be coded to use SSL/TLS).
