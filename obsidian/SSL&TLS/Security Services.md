# Security Services Provided by SSL/TLS

SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security) protocols provide several essential security services for network communication, especially over the internet. The main security services include:

---

## 1. **Confidentiality**

- **Description**: Ensures that data exchanged between the client and server remains private and cannot be read by unauthorized parties.
- **How**: Symmetric encryption is used for the session after a secure key exchange during the handshake process.

---

## 2. **Integrity Protection**

- **Description**: Safeguards data against unauthorized modification during transmission.
- **How**: Message authentication codes (MACs) or hash-based MACs (HMACs) are used to detect any alteration of the message in transit.

---

## 3. **Authentication**

- **Description**: Verifies the identity of one or both parties (client and server) in a communication session.
- **How**: Digital certificates and public key cryptography are used during the handshake to prove the identity of the server (and optionally, the client).

---

## 4. **Session Key Establishment**

- **Description**: Securely generates and negotiates session-specific cryptographic keys that will be used for encrypting and authenticating the communication session.
- **How**: Public key cryptography and secure handshake protocols are used to agree on fresh, unique session keys for each session.

---

## 5. **Replay Protection and Freshness**

- **Description**: Protects against replay attacks by ensuring that each session and each message is unique and cannot be reused in a malicious way.
- **How**: Uses random numbers (nonces), sequence numbers, and session identifiers to ensure freshness.

SSL/TLS is widely used for securing internet traffic (such as HTTPS), protecting data in transit, and ensuring trustworthy communication between clients and servers.
